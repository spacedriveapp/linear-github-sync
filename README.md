# Linear GitHub Sync

**This repository is deprecated** and is officially survived by [SyncLinear.com](https://github.com/calcom/synclinear.com).

---

This is a system to synchronize Linear issues to GitHub issues when a specific tag tag is added to the Linear issue. Spacedrive uses this to allow contributors to work with us without having to give them access to our internal Linear team.
